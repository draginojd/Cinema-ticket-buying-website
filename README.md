# Cinema ticket buying website created by me

My Github name: draginojd

# Original repository where the project first got created: https://github.com/webcrunch/Filmvisarna

#You can track all my progress in the original repository and in this current one.

## I downloaded this project as a zip and created a new repository on my own Github so I could continue working on the website without the need of others accepting my pull requests.

```js
npm run init
```
